			<h2>Our Mission</h2>
			<p>The goal of this site is to provide background information on Climate Science for the non-specialist.</p>
			<article>
			<p>I created this site to add to the voices who understand that climate science is not a hoax and all that goes with that.  The purpose of this site is to give some background on the basics of climate science and why so many scientists back it.  This is unusual.  It is rare for a large group of people with a background in science to actually agree on something.  This is a basic fact that most of the people who find fault with the basic science of climate often conveniently ignore.</p>  

			<p>There is a long history of "skepticism" in science.  Skepticism is an important feature about how science advances new ideas.  Skepticism is about doubting the results that somebody may obtain.  It brings about a refinement of arguments, ideas and experiments that lead to better results in the long run.   After a period of time the major objections get ironed out and we are left with a level of understanding that many can believe in.  We understand the basics of the science and its limitations.  The thing about climate science is the basic fact that the science at its base is nearly rwo hundred years old.   It's not as if Al Gore invented it in the 1990s.</p>  

			<p>In these days "skepticism", when it comes to climate has come to mean outright denial.  This denial has many sources but the two main sources seem to be money and politics.  The money side of it is in the form of the fossil fuel companies and their investors who stand to lose the most as the world transitions to non-fossil energy sources.  The politics is largely in the form of people who will have less power during and after such a transition.  They can get their followers to believe what they need even in the face of overwhelming evidence.  This happened because of outright lies in some cases and misrepresentations of established scientific facts in others.</p>  

			<p>The best way out of this is by education.  Climate science can be very complex but at it's base are some simple ideas.  Those who oppose the results of climate science rely on hiding behind the complexity.  Part of this complexity is manifest in the uncertainties that result.  For instance, we know that sea-level will rise but how much, where and when is not as clear it allows the deniers can say that it's not really happening or that we are wrong about what is happening.   However, insurance actuaries understand the issue so that obtaining insurance on beach-front property is becoming increasingly difficult and expensive.</p>
