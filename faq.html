			<h2>Our Mission</h2>
			<p>The goal of this site is to provide background information on Climate Science for the non-specialist.</p>
			<article>
			<p>Q. What is climate?</p><br>  
<p>A.  It can be said that "Climate is what we expect, Weather is what we get."   (This quote is often attributed to Mark Twain but that is probably incorrect.  For a discussion see  <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/06/24/climate-vs-weather.">Quote Investigator</a> The IPCC uses the basic definition that Climate is weather averaged over a thirty year time span.</p><br><br>  

			<p>Q.  What is the IPCC?</p><br>
<p>A.  The IPCC is an independent agency of the United Nations.  The acronym means the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  They publish regular updates on the current status of Climate Science.  The most recent full release was AR5 (The fifth assessment report.)  https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/syr/</p><br><br>

<p>Q.  How can we predict climate over centuries when the weatherman isn't even right for next week?
<p>A.  The averaging process over thirty year time frames smooths out the daily variations which make weather prediction difficult.</p><br><br>  

<p>Q.  What is a climate model?</p><br>
<p>A.  There are many different kinds of climate models.  They are generally based on well-established laws of Physics, Chemistry and Biology.  Many of these scientific laws have been known and understood for decades to centuries.  A typical model is a large computer program that uses the known scientific laws to predict climate.  There are thousands of variables in a typical climate model.  Many of them divide the atmosphere into smaller "cells" within each cell the equations associated with the scientific laws are programmed.  The large number of variables comes from all the different physical properties, density, composition, temperature, pressure etc. in each cell.</p><br><br>

<p>Q.  There's only about 500 parts per million of Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere.  How is that a big deal?</p><br>  
<p>A.  For one, the CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere has a very long residence time compared with other Greenhouse gases like water vapor or methane.  For another, as it absorbs Infrared light it gets hotter. It then passes that higher temperature on to the main gases in the atmosphere as the CO<sub>2</sub> molecules collide with the molecules of Nitrogen and Oxygen.

<p>Q.  What is climate sensitivity? </p><br>  
<p>A.  Climate sensitivity answers a simple question:  For a given amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere, what is the average surface temperature?   The answer is not so simple.</p><br><br>

<p>Q.  Why is climate sensitivity considered to be an unknown?</p><br>
<p>A.  There isn't an equation for it that we can put into the climate models.  It is a result that comes out of  a given climate model.  Different models give different answers.  We have a range of values for climate sensitivity because of this.  In a typical model run the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> may be put in as a preliminary number then the average surface temperature comes out of the calculation.</p><br><br>

<p>Q.  What is feedback?</p><br>
<p>A.  There are several sources of feedback in the climate system.  A positive feedback is one where a result of atmospheric heating causes more heating.  A negative feedback would cause less heating as the temperature rises.  The problem is there are several strong positive feedbacks but no strong negative feedbacks.   Clouds are a mixed bag, having some positive and some negative feedbacks. </p><br>

<p>An example of a positive feedback in the climate system is the so-called Ice-Albedo feedback.  The ice in the arctic is mostly white and cause quite a bit of the sunlight coming in to be simply reflected.  As it melts more of the dark ocean surface is exposed which absorbs sunlight and gets warmer causing more ice to melt.  Albedo is a term used to discuss the reflectivity of the surface.</p><br><br>
