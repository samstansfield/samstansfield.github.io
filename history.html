				<h2>A brief history of critical moments in Climate Science</h2><br>

<p>When looking at a history of Climate science one wonders where to begin.  This is always the case when looking at the history of any science.  Who was there when it all began?  Isaac Newton is known to have said "If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants." </p><br> 

<p>A logical place to begin is with Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier, usually known as Joseph Fourier.  In 1824 Fourier started with a much older physical idea called "Newton's law of cooling".  This law gives mathematical relationships to determine how quickly an object will cool when heated.  Fourier demonstrated that the Earth should be a lot colder than it is.  He proposed that the reason the Earth is warmer is because there is something about the atmosphere which traps heat and keeps it from cooling.  This is an effect which we now call "The Greenhouse Effect" because the atmosphere acts like the glass on a greenhouse.  He did not call it that, however.</p><br>

<p>Infrared radiation was discovered in 1800 by Friedrich Wilhelm Herschel, known as Sir William Herschel.  He was doing experiments to determine the "temperature" of different colors of light.  He discovered that the "dark" area next to red light had a higher temperature than any of the visible "colors".</p><br>  

<p>In 1859 an Irish scientist named John Tyndall made detailed measurements of a wide variety of gases to determine how they absorb light.  He found that some gases in particular absorb quite a bit of infrared light.  These gases which we now call the "Greenhouse Gases" are the best absorbers of infrared.  These include Water Vapor, Carbon Dioxide (which he called Carbonic Acid), Ozone and Hydrocarbons.  Later in 1863 he wrote an explanation of the greenhouse effect (he didn't call it that either).  We  now understand that it is molecules with three or more atoms which are the greenhouse gasses.  The atmosphere is mostly Nitrogen and Oxygen which have two atoms in their molecules and are not greenhouse gases.</p><br>

<p>In the 1890s a Swedish chemist by the name of Svante Arrhenius had read about the experiments of Tyndall and Fourier asked himself the following question:  If the fraction of Carbonic Acid in the atmosphere were to double, what would happen to the temperature?   After some analysis he reached the conclusion that the temperature would rise considerably.  He actually thought this would be a good thing since it would lengthen the growing season in Sweden.   Since that time the fraction of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere has nearly doubled, mostly from the use of fossil fuels by humans.</p><br>  

<p>Fast forward some more to 1938.  An English steam engineer named Guy Stewart Callendar was the first to compare actual temperature data to the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere and found a correlation between the two sets of data.  Of course, in science correlation does not imply causality.  It takes physical theory to make that connection but the work of Arrhenius and others who came later allow us to make that connection.  Callendar only used Northern hemisphere data so his results are not necessarily world-wide.</p><br>   

<p>In the 1970s, James Hansen and his colleagues were working with a dataset now known as GISSTEMP.  Which is an acronym for the Goddard Institute of Space Studies Temperature series.  It is a set of weather stations data which looks at how temperatures change on a daily basis world wide.   There are both land based and sea based stations in the GISSTEMP dataset.  Hansen testified before the U.S. Congress on 6/23/1988 that there was a relationship between CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the atmosphere and the average temperature.</p><br>  

<p>In the thirty years since Hansen's testimony the measurements have been improved as well as our understanding of the theoretical connections between CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature.  Also much work has been done to look at the consequences of rising temperatures.  In 1988 an independent agency of the United Nations was formed known as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or the IPCC.  The IPCC puts out regular reports on the current state of the science and our understanding of how climate works.</p><br>
