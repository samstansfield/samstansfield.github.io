				<h3>The Greenhouse Effect</h3><br><br>
				
				<p>One of the main purposes of this site is to provide simplified explanations of Climate Science for the non-specialist.  One of the problems with that goal is the sheer complexity of Climate Science.  Any discussion can start out fairly simply but the complexity takes over quickly and it is easy to get bogged down in details.  The basic problem is this:  If we make it too simple then important features get left out but too much complexity will cause people to move on and not learn the basics. </p>

<p>The diagram above shows the basic outline of the atmospheric greenhouse effect.  This effect has been known about for almost two centuries but it wasn't called that until the 1930s.  The basic idea is that (visible) sunlight comes into the atmosphere (this is called "Insolation").  That sunlight then heats the Earth's surface.  An important step is that the heated surface then gives off (radiates) infrared light (which is not visible but we can sense it as "heat").  This infrared light is then absorbed by certain gases in the atmosphere which causes it to warm up.   The warming atmosphere also interacts with the oceans and causes them to warm as well.  The numbers are in Watts per square meter which is a standard unit of intensity.</p>
				
<p>  Note there are several other arrows on the diagram.  One respresents Infrared which is re-radiated from the atmosphere to the ground.  Another represents the heat which is emitted to the atmosphere from the vapor-liquid transformation in water.  The third shows thermals, where air flow from the hot ground heats the atmosphere directly (the origin of the phrase "heat rises").</p>				

<p>That seems simple enough but the devil is in the details of how it occurs.  All of the steps which are outlined here are based on physical laws which have been known for almost 200 years.  Let's examine some of the steps in detail.</p>

<p>The most important step is the absorption of Infrared light by the "Greenhouse Gases" in the atmosphere.  Any gas with three or more atoms in a molecule is a one of these gases.  Most of the atmosphere is Nitrogen (78%) and Oxygen (21%).  These are both "diatomic" which means they only have two atoms per molecule and don't absorb any significant amount of Infrared light.  Notice that between them they make up 99% of the atmosphere.</p>  

<p>There are two things which must be defined more precisely.  One is "Temperature" and the other is "Heat".  These are not the same thing at all but they are related.  For a gas the Temperature is defined in terms of the motion of the molecules.  It is proportional to the average speed of molecules.  When the average speed goes up so does the temperature.</p>  

<p>Heat is a lot trickier.  It is made more complicated because we have the term "Heat up" in English which uses Heat as a verb, it expresses a change in temperature.  In Physics, however, Heat is not a verb, it is a noun.  It is a form of energy.  One of the basic laws of Physics which is called the Law of Conservation of Energy or the First Law of Thermodynamics (two different names for the same Physical Law) is about how this thing called energy can never be created or destroyed it just changes form.  Heat is a particular kind of energy.  It is the kind of energy that can cause the temperature to increase when absorbed or to decrease when emitted.</p>  

<p>The biggest part of any discussion about Climate Science is really about how heat moves in the atmosphere. </p> 

<p>The next step is to think about the greenhouse gases (GHGs).  These are the trace gases which have three or more atoms per molecule.  Some of the main examples are Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), Water Vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O and Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>).  There are others as well but they are not as important for this discussion although for a full treatment they all need to be looked at as well.  The most important thing about these gases is that they trap Infrared light.  It causes them to vibrate or rotate faster.  This extra speed translates into having a higher temperature (more energy).  This extra energy can then get transferred to the Oxygen and Nitrogen in the atmosphere when the GHG molecules collide with them.</p>

<p>Let's begin with Water Vapor.  In many ways it is the most complicated of the greenhouse gases.  The thing that is most important about water is the basis fact that we live on a planet whose surface is mostly water.  Plus the temperatures which are common  put us in the range where all three phases: Solid, Liquid and Gas are relatively common in the atmosphere.  (Mars is also known to have some water but it is so cold that most of the water there is frozen.)  One of the most important parts is that when water changes from one of these phases to another it either absorbs or gives off heat depending on which direction it goes.  If the liquid absorbs heat it will eventually turn into vapor.  If it converts into Solid (Ice) it will give off the heat.  Evaporation occurs when liquid water turns into vapor and precipitation occurs when vapor turns into liquid.</p>  

<p>The temperature high in the atmosphere is a lot colder (generally) than close to the surface so water can evaporate from the surface, it then rises in the atmosphere and the colder temperatures cause it to turn back into liquid.  It then will precipitate (rain) the now liquid water onto the surface.  This is the evaporation/precipitation cycle.  If it's colder it will turn to ice instead making snow, sleet or hail depending on other factors.  Heat is trapped or emitted at the different steps in this process.</p>  

<p>Another important feature of water vapor is that the atmosphere holds more water vapor if the temperature is high then when it is low.  Plus, water vapor is a greenhouse gas so it absorbs infrared light making it warmer.   The net effect is, as the temperature of the atmosphere rises it holds more water and there is more heat released as it converts from vapor to liquid.  Finally, water doesn't stay in the atmosphere for a very long time, relatively speaking.  Thus it is constantly being converted from liquid to vapor and back.  Because of the short residence time it doesn't contribute that much to long-term climate issues.</p>

<p>The thing about water and the greenhouse effect is the basic fact that the whole water cycle is a response to higher or lower temperatures.  When the temperature is higher there is more of it than when it is lower.  Most of what we think of as "Weather" has to do with how the atmosphere is handling the water.</p>

<p>Methane, it turns out, is much more potent as a greenhouse gas than CO<sub>2</sub> is.  This means that it absorbs more Infrared light than the CO<sub>2</sub> does.  Thus it gets hotter, quicker and transfers that heat to the rest of the atmosphere.  The thing is that Methane undergoes a natural chemical reaction where it combines with Oxygen to form Water and Carbon Dioxide.  It takes a relatively short time for this reaction to happen.  Thus Methane can be important for atmospheric heating but it doesn't last that long so doesn't contribute much to long-term climate issues.</p>

<p>The really important part about CO<sub>2</sub> is it's long residence time in the atmosphere.  There are ways to remove it naturally.  The oceans actually takes up about half of the CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere.  In the long term this causes the oceans to become more acidic which has serious long-term consequences for various shell-fish and corals.  The rest of it stays around for many years, certainly centuries and perhaps millennia.</p>  

<p>A certain amount of CO<sub>2</sub> is also used by green plants in the usual photosynthesis process.  The carbon from this process is part of the "carbon cycle".   Green plants use the CO<sub>2</sub>, along with water and sunlight to form sugars.  They also produce Oxygen during photosynthesis.  Animals then eat the plants, they metabolize the sugars.  At the same time animals also breath in the Oxygen and exhale CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>    

<p>The main problem is that humans have been extracting fossilized carbon from underground, converting it to CO<sub>2</sub> and putting it into the atmosphere.  Reversing this process is quite difficult.  The natural process takes thousands to millions of years.</p>
